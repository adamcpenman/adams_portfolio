                        <p>Hello! My name is Adam Penman. Pronouns are 'He/Him/His'. <br/>I am a full-stack developer and a magical being. <br />
                            I have learned various different langaugaes and libraries, but consistently reviewing and
                            learning new ways to write code every day. I've attended Lambda School which has
                            provided an excellent base and a grasp on core concepts. Currently, searching for the right full-time role as a
                            Software Developer. I want to be able to create dynamic, creative, user friendly content while
                            having the necessary tools for a continious learning environment and expand my skills as a Software Developer!
