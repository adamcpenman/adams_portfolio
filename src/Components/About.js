                    <p>Hello, Hello, Hello! My name is Adam Penman. Pronouns are 'He/Him/His'. I am a full-stack developer and a magical being. <br/>
                        I have learned various different langaugaes and libraries, but consistently reviewing and 
                        learning new ways to write code every day. I've attended Lambda School which has 
                        provided an excellent base and a grasp on core concepts. Currently, searching for the right full-time role as a 
                        Software Developer. I want to be able to create dynamic, creative, user friendly content while
                        having the necessary tools for a continious learning environment and expand my skills as a Software Developer! Feel Free to contact me with any questions!
