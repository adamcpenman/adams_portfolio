                            <p>Hello! My name is Adam Penman. Pronouns are 'He/Him/His'. <br />I am a full-stack developer. <br />
                                I have learned various different langaugaes and libraries, but consistently reviewing and
                                learning new ways to write code every day. I've attended Lambda School which has
                                provided an excellent base and a grasp on core concepts. Currently, searching for the right full-time role as a
                                Software Developer. I want to be able to create dynamic, creative, user friendly content while
                                having the necessary tools for a continious learning environment and expand my skills as a Software Developer!
